# Homework 1
## Getting started with HTML

Now that we have experience with some of the basic block and inline elements in HTML, you should be able to create a simple recipe.

Find a recipe that you are fond of. Maybe its a family recipe that you miss, or a dish from the dining hall that you enjoy. Maybe its something you haven't had but find interesting. It can be anything really, as long as there is a list of ingredients, steps for its creation, and a description in the beginning.

### Here is the criteria for what I'm expecting:
- a complete html document without errors
- an image of the item you are describing somewhere on the page
- a description of the final product

   Within the description you should find words that can be appropriately emphasized using italics and bolding.

- an ordered list of steps to create the item
- an unordered list of ingredients
- appropriate headings for each section
